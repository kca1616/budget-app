## MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api for records
- Render data on page 
- Have user create wishlist with CRUD capabilities

#### PostMVP  

- Add "marketplace" where users can offer up records for sale
- Add ability with marketplace to send counter offers. 
- Enable messaging to negotitate how things will be shipped out.
- Give suggestions from marketplace for records that users have in wishlist 


## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
