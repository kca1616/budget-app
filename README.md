## MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api for records
- Render data on page 
- Provider users the ability to create wishlists with CRUD capabilities.

#### PostMVP  

- Add "Marketplace" where users can offer up records for sale.
- Add "Offer" feature to marketplace to send counter offers. 
- Add "Messaging" to negotiate sales and how the purchased items will be shipped out.
- Provide suggestions from marketplace for records that users have in wishlist.

## SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths: 

 - Passionate about vinyl records, so I will be interested in the
   project and continue to develop my platform.  
 - Good with front-end development.

#### Weaknesses:

 - Minimal understanding of authentication, authorization, and login
   implementations in Flask.

#### Opportunities:

 - Getting to improve on authN/Z and login processes.
 - Learn about database optimizations.
